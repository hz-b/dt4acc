    Most values will be updated immediately e.g. power converter
    readback or setpoint. Some will be delayed e.g. as
    beam position monitor.

    To explain in detail:
    * immediate:

        * for setpoints: as soon as the view will be changed the
          read command will be dispatched to the controller (as
          an update command)

        * For monitors: the read command will be used to retrieve
          the data

    * delayed:
        * the read commmand will be added to the delayed evaluations

    * never:
        * the controller shall ignore the read command given here
          something else (the view ?) takes care to fill these
          data
    Please note: this setting is (mainly) used at startup. Monitors
    (like power converter readback) can be read immediately at
    initialisation. Beam position data or Twiss data are typically
    obtained as delayed ones: these are derived from optics data.
    Optics calculation is on only performed after all setpoints
    have been set.

    Todo:
        review if it should be handled differently ?
        e.g. all BPM declare a read command of ['track', 'pos']
        then view dispatches it to them
        or converter object does it ...
